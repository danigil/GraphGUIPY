# GraphGUIPY
This project is a GUI for showing graphs and running algorithms on them that's written in python.
## Introduction
This GUI is designed to load and save graphs from json files, display them on the screen,</br> allow various interactions such as: deleting nodes, inserting edges, running algorithms on the graph and receiving feedback.  
This GUI is supposed to be a mirror of previous work, only written in python instead of java.  
In the program we allow use of different graph algorithms such as TSP, shortest distance between two nodes, find center point.
